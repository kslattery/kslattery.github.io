description: I am a C/C++ programmer in Kansas City, MO. I've worked on interfacing to medical devices, enterprise message bus and framework libraries for a large software suite, and cross platform mobile device based biometric security. I'm also as close as you can get to a Linux System Engineer while still being a programmer that doesn't know how to create a Linux volume without googling it.

More information coming soon.
