								<h4>2017-2018</h4>
                                <p>Assisted with C++ development of a cross platform augmented reality mobile device app by troubleshooting, fixing bugs, and modernizing code.</p>
                                <p>Developing a website with React/Redux/Express/Node/MongoDB to support clients choosing features for a product, seeing their choices incorporated in an augmented reality view, and receiving updates on the progress of their product's completion.</p>
                                <p>Developing a wearable device capable of tracking the wearer's location and alerting caregivers when the wearer strays from predetermined locations through a cross platform mobile device app. This work includes sourcing hardware components in China, modifying the default Android installation on the devices, development of an app on the wearable device to collect the necessary data, development of a mobile app for the caregivers, and development of a server infrastructure to support the project.</p>

								<h2>EyeVerify (now ZOLOZ)</h2>
								<h3>Product Architect - Core</h3>
								<h4>2015-2017</h4>
                                <p>Implemented a Trusted Application for VKey's V-OS software secure element for use in securing cryptographic keys on iOS and Android devices, with a C++ wrapper around the C interface required by V-OS to abstract the interface into an easily consumed API. </p>
                                <p>Created application performance benchmarks and analyzed data to find areas of improvement to meet SLA requirements. </p>
                                <p>Completely overhauled compiler options for both XCode and cmake build systems to remove sensitive IP from endstates delivered to clients, decrease resultant app size to meet aggressive size requirements of the client, and improve consistency of delivered products between releases. Also improved build scripts for consistency, ease of use, and maintainability.</p>
                                <p>Investigated and began proof-of-concept implementation of EyeVerify technology within an OEM Android image to use the Trusted Execution Environment for sensitive storage and cryptographic operations. </p>
                                <p>Represented EyeVerify on a dance team that performed in front of an audience of ten thousand fellow Ant Financial employees at the largest stadium in China. </p>

                                <p><i>The Millennium Foundations team owns hundreds of C++ projects with millions of lines of code with APIs consumed by scores of other teams writing applications used in hundreds of health systems in the US and globally. The team is responsible for all middleware, marshalling, and inter-process communication in the Millennium N-tier architecture, along with the logging subsystem, common data structure classes, the database interface, daemon lifecycle management, installation scripts, makefiles for all C++ projects, and creating standard interfaces for OS-specific system calls.  </i></p> 
                                <p>Oversaw technical requirements and vision for Foundation's large legacy codebase. Provided expert advice to teams consuming our APIs. Represented team in cross-team initiatives. Trained new team members.</p>
								<p>Led the porting of millions of lines of code of Cerner Millenium's 900+ C++ projects to run on Linux, saving Cerner one billion dollars in hardware costs. </p>
                                <p>Worked closely with the teams responsible for deploying and supporting Foundation's code to ease deployment and address both common issues and high-visibility issues needing immediate resolution. </p>
                                <p>Created and championed an extensive wiki site with documentation for fellow team members and consumers of our APIs that was used daily by people throughout the company. Presented in-depth information at internal developer conferences on topics from IPv6 to debugging strategies and tools.</p>
                                <p>Re-architected old brittle modules to provide stability in system-critical processes and enable future enhancements. Implemented code in modern style.</p>
